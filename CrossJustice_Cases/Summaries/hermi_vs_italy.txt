Norm 1: Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights
Description 1: Article 6 of the Convention guarantees the right to a fair trial, which includes the right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against one in a language that one understands, the right to defend oneself in person or through legal assistance, the right to examine witnesses, and the right to the free assistance of an interpreter if one cannot understand or speak the language used in court. In the case at hand, the applicant, a Tunisian citizen, argued that he was not able to participate in an appeal hearing due to not being transferred from prison to the courtroom and that he did not fully understand the Italian language, which was used in the legal proceedings against him.

Norm 2: Article 34 of the European Convention on Human Rights
Description 2: Article 34 allows individuals to apply to the European Court of Human Rights if they believe they have been a victim of a violation of the rights set forth in the Convention by one of the Member States. The applicant utilized this right by submitting a complaint against the Italian Republic, alleging violations of his rights under Article 6 of the Convention due to his inability to participate in his appeal hearing and issues regarding language comprehension.

Norm 3: Articles 438 - 443 of the Italian Code of Criminal Procedure (CPP) - Abbreviated Trial Procedure
Description 3: The abbreviated trial procedure under the Italian CPP allows for a simplified and expedited trial process upon the request of the defendant, which can lead to a reduced sentence if convicted. The procedure primarily relies on the documents already in the case file, and the presence of the defendant is not deemed as crucial as in ordinary proceedings. The applicant had initially requested this procedure, which influenced the proceedings and his participation in them.
