Norm 1: Article 112 of the Italian Code of Civil Procedure (c.p.c.)
Description 1: This norm concerns the obligation of the judge to address every issue raised by the parties. The appellant argued that the Tribunal of Cagliari omitted to pronounce on an exception regarding the nullity of the administrative act for lack of indication on the appeal regime. However, this was deemed inadmissible as the appellant had no interest in raising the issue, given that the rejection was appealed in due terms, and no prejudice resulted from it.

Norm 2: Law No. 286 of 1998, Article 5 (Italian Immigration Law)
Description 2: This law regulates the conditions under which a foreign national may be granted a residence permit for humanitarian reasons, considering the individual's integration into Italian society and the conditions in the country of origin. The appellant contested the Tribunal of Cagliari's decision, which denied humanitarian protection despite his employment in Italy, arguing insufficient integration and no risk upon return to Bangladesh. The Supreme Court found this reasoning flawed, highlighting the lack of a comparative assessment of the appellant's integration in Italy and the conditions in Bangladesh. The Court recognized the potential violation of fundamental rights due to socio-political conditions or inescapable poverty in the country of origin. Consequently, the Court overturned the Tribunal's decision, accepting the appeal based on the violation of Law No. 286 of 1998, Article 5, and remanded the case for re-evaluation.
