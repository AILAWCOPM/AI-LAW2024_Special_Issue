Norm 1: Directive 2010/64/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 October 2010 on the right to interpretation and translation in criminal proceedings
Description 1: This Directive establishes the right to interpretation and translation for individuals involved in criminal proceedings who do not understand or speak the language used in those proceedings. It aims to ensure that accused or suspected persons can fully exercise their right of defense and that the fairness of the proceedings is safeguarded. The Directive applies from the time individuals are made aware they are suspected or accused of a crime until the conclusion of the proceedings, including sentencing and any appeal.

Norm 2: Directive 2012/13/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2012 on the right to information in criminal proceedings
Description 2: This Directive lays down rules concerning the right of suspects or accused persons to be informed about their rights in criminal proceedings and the accusation against them. It ensures that individuals are promptly provided with information necessary to safeguard the fairness of the proceedings and the effective exercise of the rights of the defense. The Directive covers the period from when individuals are informed they are suspected or accused of a crime until the final determination of the proceedings.

Case Context: The case involved Mr. Gavril Covaci, a Romanian citizen accused of road traffic offenses in Germany, who received a penalty order imposing a fine. Covaci, who did not have a fixed domicile or residence within Germany, was required to appoint a person authorized to accept service on his behalf, with the period for lodging an objection against the penalty order beginning from the service on the authorized person. Covaci's legal representatives questioned whether the requirement to lodge an objection in German and the procedures for serving the penalty order complied with the Directives 2010/64/EU and 2012/13/EU.

Judgment: The Court of Justice of the European Union ruled that the Directives do not preclude national legislation that requires objections against penalty orders to be lodged in the language of the court proceedings, provided that the competent authorities do not consider such an objection to constitute an essential document under Directive 2010/64/EU. Furthermore, the Court determined that Directive 2012/13/EU does not preclude legislation requiring an accused person not residing in the Member State to appoint a person authorized to accept service of a penalty order, as long as the accused person effectively has the benefit of the entire prescribed period for lodging an objection against that order.
