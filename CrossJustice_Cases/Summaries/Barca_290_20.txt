Norm 1: Law 23/2014 of 20 November on the mutual recognition of criminal judgments in the European Union, Article 205 and subsequent articles.
Description 1: This norm establishes the framework for the mutual recognition of criminal judgments within the EU, including the procedures for executing European Investigation Orders (EIOs). In this case, the Spanish authorities received an EIO from the Netherlands concerning an investigation into a public health offense linked to organized crime and money laundering. The requested investigative measure was a search and seizure at a specific address in Sant Andreu de Llavaneres.

Norm 2: Law 23/2014 of 20 November on the mutual recognition of criminal judgments in the European Union, Article 206.
Description 2: Article 206 outlines the conditions under which an executing state may consider alternative measures to those requested in an EIO if the desired outcome can be achieved by less intrusive means or if the requested measure is not provided for in the national law. In this context, the Spanish court initially denied the search and seizure request, considering it disproportionate based on the evidence provided, and suggested police surveillance as a less invasive measure.

Norm 3: Law 23/2014 of 20 November on the mutual recognition of criminal judgments in the European Union, Article 206, paragraph 4.
Description 3: This provision requires that before denying an EIO or substituting it with a less restrictive measure, the executing authority must contact the issuing authority to discuss the possibility of obtaining additional information or considering alternative measures. In the case at hand, the Spanish court's initial decision to deny the search and seizure request without first consulting with the Dutch authorities was found to be in violation of this procedure, leading to the appeal being upheld and the decision being overturned.
