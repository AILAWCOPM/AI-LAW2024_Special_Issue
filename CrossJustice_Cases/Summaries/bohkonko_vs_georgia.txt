Norm 1: Article 3 (procedural) of the European Convention on Human Rights
Description 1: This norm mandates an effective investigation into allegations of ill-treatment. In the case of Bokhonko v. Georgia, the applicant's criminal complaint regarding ill-treatment during a police strip search was rejected without any investigative steps being undertaken, constituting a violation of this procedural aspect of Article 3.

Norm 2: Article 3 (substantive) of the European Convention on Human Rights
Description 2: This norm prohibits degrading treatment. The Court found insufficient evidence to establish a violation of the substantive limb of Article 3 concerning the manner in which the strip search was conducted, due to the lack of an effective investigation into the applicant's allegations.

Norm 3: Article 6 § 1 (criminal) of the European Convention on Human Rights
Description 3: This norm ensures the fairness of legal proceedings, including the use of evidence obtained. The Court concluded that the failure of national courts to properly address the applicant's allegations of ill-treatment and the use of evidence obtained as a result, prejudiced the fairness of the trial, leading to a violation of Article 6 § 1.

Norm 4: Article 6 § 1 (criminal) and Article 6 § 3 (e) of the European Convention on Human Rights
Description 4: These norms guarantee the right to a fair trial and the free assistance of an interpreter. The Court found that the applicant received appropriate linguistic assistance, allowing him to adequately participate in the trial, and therefore, there was no violation of Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (e).
